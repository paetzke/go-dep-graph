* go-dep-graph

Go-dep-graph can be used to produce visualisations of package and file dependencies of Go(lang) source code.

[[http://paetzke.me/static/images/go-dep-graph.ps.png]]

Usage:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ go-dep-graph [OPTIONS] directory...
#+END_SRC

Options:

- p: show only packages, not files
- s: don't show standard packages

Go-dep-graph produces output that's suitable for graphviz. Just pipe the output to it.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ ./go-dep-graph -p -s $GOPATH/src | dot -Tpdf -O
#+END_SRC
